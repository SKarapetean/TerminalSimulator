# Terminal Simulator like Linux File System

This repository contains a terminal simulator that simulates the Linux file system. The simulator is implemented using Java and includes several classes to represent different components of the file system.

## Project Overview

The terminal simulator provides a virtual environment to interact with a simulated file system. It includes the following classes:

- `DefaultDirectories.java`: This class represents the default directories in the simulated file system.
- `Directory.java`: Represents a directory within the file system, containing files and subdirectories.
- `File.java`: Represents a file within a directory.
- `FileSystemBuilder.java`: Provides methods to build the file system and its components.
- `FileSystemComponent.java`: A base class for all file system components, providing common functionality.
- `HardLink.java`: Represents a hard link between two file system components.
- `Permission.java`: Represents the permission settings for files and directories.
- `SoftLink.java`: Represents a symbolic link or symlink.

## Getting Started

To use the terminal simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
 
2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler:

4. Run the compiled Java program:

## Usage

Once the terminal simulator is running, you can use it to simulate interactions with the file system. You can create directories, add files, create hard and soft links, and manage permissions.

Refer to the documentation within each class file for detailed explanations of their functionality and methods.
